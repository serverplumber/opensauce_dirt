# OpenSauce Product Plan -- Bakery ERP Roadmap

Last updated: 2025-11-09 (Overview nav + planner polish)

## Progress Snapshot

- Overall: [ ] Not started / [x] In progress / [ ] Done
- Current Cycle (Oct 2025): Stabilize internal print flows + prep costing foundations.
- Active Initiative: Close M1 (costing UX) → kick off M2 (Traceability & Compliance).
- Milestone Health
  - [ ] M1: Production Costing Foundations
  - [ ] M2: Traceability & Compliance
  - [x] M3: Inventory Planning & Purchasing
  - [ ] M4: WhatsApp Business Integration
  - [ ] M5: Insights & Pricing Intelligence
  - [ ] M6: Onboarding & Adoption

## Recently Completed

- Overview promoted to its own Manage nav at `/manage/overview`; Production now defaults to Schedule.
- Planner split into Overview/Schedule tabs; schedule calendar isolates day view.
- Over-capacity highlights in planner with metrics modal across tabs.
- Make Sheet print view hides navigation and actions; invoice printable HTML scaffolded.
- Product capacity (`max_daily_quantity`) enforced at checkout alongside global capacity.
- Public storefront retired in favor of a login-first screen; capacity/tax/fulfillment settings remain for internal planning.
- CSV import LiveComponent refactor with reusable wizard, per-entity configs, and LiveView tests.
- Orders and Inventory LiveViews aligned to settings-inspired layout primitives with shared components.

## Competitive Insights -- Craftybase Highlights

- Multi-stage BOMs with components/sub-assemblies and labor costing; generates real-time cost rollups and pricing suggestions.
- Compliance and traceability tooling: lot/batch tracking, recall workflows, audit-friendly reports.
- Location-aware inventory with stock transfers, consignment tracking, and guided stocktake/cycle count tooling.
- Automated COGS calculations (GAAP/IRS aligned) feeding reports and profitability dashboards.
- Integrated channel sync (Shopify, Etsy, Square, Faire, Wix, WooCommerce, Amazon Handmade) with real-time stock updates.
- Templates and calculators (pricing, production planning) supporting onboarding and ongoing price optimization.

## Guiding Principles

- Operate -> Make -> Stock remains the primary loop; extend with costing and compliance primitives rather than bespoke workflows.
- Self-host friendly and offline tolerant: webhooks/integrations should degrade gracefully to CSV or manual sync.
- Favor declarative Ash resources and LiveView streams; keep imperative logic in services only when needed.
- Every new surface must support printable artifacts (labels, planner, invoices, compliance reports).

## Milestone 1 -- Production Costing Foundations

**Status:** [ ] Not started [x] In progress [ ] Done

### Goals

- Match competitor parity on multi-stage recipes, labor costing, and automated batch cost rollups.
- Provide pricing guidance hooks that later feed Insights.

### User Stories

- As a product developer, I build a BOM with components, sub-assemblies, and labor entries.
- As an operator, completing a batch generates actual cost per unit and suggested price ranges.
- As a planner, I see batch codes auto-generated when marking production done.

### Requirements

**Domain**

- [x] New Ash resources for BOM structures: `Catalog.BOM`, `Catalog.BOMComponent`, `Catalog.LaborStep` with versioning.
- [x] Link BOM to `Catalog.Product`; support status (`draft`, `active`).
- [x] Labor rates and overhead settings in `Settings` (hourly rate, markup defaults).
- [x] Batch cost calculation service generating `material_cost`, `labor_cost`, `overhead_cost`, `unit_cost`.
- [x] Auto-generate `batch_code` (`B-YYYYMMDD-SKU-SEQ`) when order items marked done; persist to order items.

**UI**

- [x] BOM editor (Recipe tab) backed by BOMs with simple mode save (creates new active version).
- [x] Planner "Mark Done" dialog shows resulting batch code and actual cost snapshot.
- [x] Pricing helper card on product detail showing suggested retail/wholesale prices (based on markup settings).
- [x] Cost summary on Recipe tab (read-only rollup: material/labor/overhead/unit). Updates on save/promote.

### BOM Versioning (Simple UX)

- [x] Simple header (no dropdown). Shows “Version vN” and a “Latest” chip when on newest.
- [x] When viewing an older version: show an in-page banner with “Go to latest”.
- [x] Editing disabled on older versions; Save only appears on latest version.
- [x] History surfaced via modal with action: View (no promote/duplicate/archive in simple mode). Older versions are read-only with an in-page "Go to latest" button.
- [x] Routing: `?v=:version` preselects version.
- [x] Tests updated for banner, read-only behavior, and modal actions.

### Data & Constraints for Versioning

- [x] Enforce single active BOM per product with partial unique index
  - `unique_index(:catalog_boms, [:product_id], where: "status = 'active'", name: "catalog_boms_one_active_per_product")`
- [x] `:promote` update action on `Catalog.BOM` (status -> :active; sets `published_at`).
- [x] `AssignBOMVersion` supplies version on create (no default in DB).
- [x] Rollups refreshed after create/update/promote.

**Data & Migrations**

- [x] Tables for BOMs/components/labor; migrations keep existing products unaffected until BOM assigned.
- [x] Backfill seeds with example recipes (bread, pastry) including labor.
- [x] Persisted BOM rollups (`catalog_bom_rollups`) with unique index on `bom_id`; auto-refresh on BOM/component/labor changes.
- [x] Add DB index on `catalog_bom_rollups(product_id)` to speed product cost reads.
- [x] Optional: materialized flattened components JSONB in rollups + GIN index for label/traceability queries.
 - [x] Prefer persisted rollups in product lists/details; avoid ad-hoc recalculation in LiveViews.

**Deprecations & Removals** (no backward compatibility)

- [x] Remove legacy Recipe model usage in domain and UI
  - [x] Switch Product label ingredients to BOM components (fallback not required)
  - [x] Replace product financial calculations to prefer active BOM unit cost; remove recipe-based cost calcs
  - [x] Remove `Catalog.Recipe` and `Catalog.RecipeMaterial` resources from `OpenSauce.Catalog`
  - [x] Drop `catalog_recipes` and `catalog_recipe_materials` tables via migration
- [x] Replace `Material <-> Recipe` relationships with `Material <-> BOM` through `BOMComponent`
- [x] Update planner/forecasting to load from BOMs instead of Recipes
- [x] Update seeds/tests to use BOMs exclusively; remove recipe fixtures
- [x] Remove `advanced_recipe_versioning` feature flag setting (schema + DB + seeds). Simple mode is the only UX.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Batch completion persists cost breakdown and batch code on order item; totals flow into invoices.
- Pricing helper toggles between markup types (percent/fixed) and respects inclusive/exclusive tax.
- BOM editor enforces valid graphs (no cycles) and supports saving draft vs publish.

### Next Actions (M1)

- [x] Documentation refresh: BOM editor (simple versioning), planner cost snapshot, pricing guidance, labor scaling guidance, and new Manage → Overview entry point (`/manage/overview`); update screenshots/paths (see `guides/CATALOG.md`, `guides/OVERVIEW.md`, and updated README).
- [x] Navigation QA: verify Overview active state, breadcrumbs, and post-auth landing path; ensure no stale references to `/manage/production` for overview use cases.
- [x] Link audit: grep repo for hard-coded `"/manage/production"` that intend Overview and update; keep production tools on schedule/make_sheet/materials as-is.
- [x] Performance pass: product index + planner now load BOM rollups instead of full components; inventory forecasting and materials detail views reuse `components_map` to avoid recalculation.
- [x] Usability polish: add optional “Total required” footer in consumption recap.
- [x] Enforce labor step input: prevent empty names and disallow `units_per_run = 0` in `Catalog.LaborStep`.

### Recipe → BOM Migration Plan (UI Parity)

**Goal:** keep the current Recipe editor UX intact while switching the backend to BOMs (no back-compat required), then cleanly remove Recipe.

**Phase A — Adapter (UI parity on existing route)**

- [x] Replace Recipe editor internals with BOM-backed component while preserving DOM ids, events, and layout
  - Keep route and tab labels the same for now (e.g., "Recipe") to avoid UX regression
  - Files migrated:
    - `lib/opensauce_web/live/manage/product_live/form_component_recipe.ex`
    - `lib/opensauce_web/live/manage/product_live/show.ex`
  - Form mapping
    - Materials list -> BOM components (`component_type: :material`)
    - Optional sub-assembly picker (`component_type: :product`)
    - Labor steps editor (sequence, duration_minutes, rate_override, units_per_run)
  - Reads/writes
    - Load product `:active_bom` (or create one if missing)
    - Save components/labor via BOM create/update arguments: `components`, `labor_steps`
  - Tests
    - Keep existing selectors/ids; LiveView tests exercise save + history flows

**Phase B — Domain usage switch**

- [x] Update product calculations to prefer active BOM unit cost; DB rollups first, fallback to compute or recipe only when needed
- [x] Update product label ingredients to read from BOM components; keep recipe fallback during transition
- [x] Update planner/forecast materials demand to use BOM components + rollups (remove recipe reliance)
- [x] Update consumption flows to use BOM components when completing items; align confirmation modal sources
- [x] Update seeds/fixtures to BOM only (remove recipe seeding)
  - [x] Update dev seeds to BOM-only (removed recipe seeding)

**Phase C — Cleanup and removal**

- [x] Remove Recipe resources from domain and UI
  - Delete `Catalog.Recipe` and `Catalog.RecipeMaterial`
  - Remove LiveView recipe-specific code paths
  - Drop `catalog_recipes` and `catalog_recipe_materials` tables
- [x] Replace `Material <-> Recipe` relationship with `Material <-> BOM` through `BOMComponent`

**Acceptance Criteria (UI parity)**

- The editor form keeps the same structure, ids, and interactions; users can add/edit materials and see totals like before
- Sub-assemblies and labor steps are available without changing the overall layout
- Product label, pricing calcs, and planner derive data from BOMs

### Implementation Notes

- Consider `Ash.Flow` for multi-step BOM creation to reuse validations.
- Add unit tests for cost calculator (material shrinkage, multi-step components).
- Update documentation in guides for BOM/labor usage.

## Milestone 2 -- Traceability & Compliance

**Status:** [ ] Not started [x] In progress [ ] Done

### Goals

- Ship pragmatic, printable traceability: lots on materials, batches on products, one-click recall export.
- Keep operator UX simple: defaults to FIFO; advanced lot selection optional.

### User Stories

- As a quality lead, I trace which orders used a recalled lot and export affected orders.
- As an operator, I record supplier lot and expiry on receipt and see warnings during production.
- As a regulator/customer, I print a batch label and lot usage report on demand.

### Requirements

**Domain**

- [x] Add `Inventory.Lot` (lot_code, supplier_id, expiry_date, received_at, material_id, quantity_on_hand). (see `lib/opensauce/inventory/lot.ex` + `priv/repo/migrations/20251101201014_lots_and_batches.exs`)
- [x] Extend `Inventory.Movement` to reference `lot_id` when applicable; default FIFO on consumption. (see `lib/opensauce/inventory/movement.ex` create `:adjust_stock` and `Orders.Consumption.allocate_material/5`)
- [x] Add `ProductionBatch` (batch_code, product_id, bom_id, produced_at) to group order-item completions. (see `lib/opensauce/orders/production_batch.ex`)
- [x] Track `OrderItemLot` allocation (order_item_id, lot_id, quantity_used) during consumption. (see `lib/opensauce/orders/order_item_lot.ex` + `Orders.Consumption.apply_lot_consumption/5`)
- [x] Ensure components_map guides lot allocations for nested sub-assemblies (aggregate per material). (see `lib/opensauce/orders/consumption.ex` leveraging `catalog_bom_rollups.components_map`)

**UI**

- [ ] Receiving: add lot capture (lot code, expiry) on PO receive; allocate received qty to lot.
- [ ] Planner/Orders: consumption modal shows per-material lots (FIFO default) with optional override.
- [ ] Batch label print (QR/Code128): batch_code + product + date + key materials lots.
- [ ] Traceability: lot view → downstream products/orders; batch view → upstream lots; printable report.

**Reports & Exports**

- [ ] CSV/print exports for lot recall: affected orders, quantities, contact list.

**Data & Migrations**

- [x] Migrations for Lot, ProductionBatch, and join records; indexes on lot_code, batch_code, FKs. (see `priv/repo/migrations/20251101201014_lots_and_batches.exs`)
- [x] Seeds include example lots and batch flows. (see `priv/repo/seeds.exs` lot seeding helpers)
- [x] Batch detail view linking orders, materials, and printable compliance sheet (see `OpenSauceWeb.ProductionBatchLive.Show` and new `/manage/production/batches/:batch_code` route).
- [ ] Warnings in planner when scheduled production will use expiring lots.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Given a recalled material lot, system lists all batches and orders containing it within seconds.
- Expiry warnings show within planner cards and block completion unless overridden with reason.
- Compliance exports include signature block and can be printed cleanly.

### Implementation Notes

- Start with write path + reports; lot reallocation UI is a phase-2 if needed.
- Keep `Orders.Consumption` the single entry point; inject lot selection there.
- Build queries via `Ash.Query.load/2` and `components_map` to avoid recomputation.

## Milestone 3 -- Inventory Planning & Purchasing

**Status:** [ ] Not started [x] In progress [ ] Done

### Goals

- Move beyond low-stock alerts to actionable purchase workflows with location awareness.

### Progress

- ✅ Forecast calculator + Ash `:owner_grid_metrics` action shipped (Milestone A per [plans/inventory_forecast_grid.md](./inventory_forecast_grid.md)).
- ✅ Milestone B kickoff: split the Usage Forecast grid from the new Reorder Planner (`/manage/inventory/forecast/reorder`), which now hosts the metrics band + service-level controls; telemetry + risk filters land next.
- 📋 LiveView + Purchasing dependencies tracked in `plans/inventory_forecast_grid.md` Next Steps section;

### Next Up

- Implement ForecastLive control defaults + event wiring, then land metrics band & right-rail glossary.
- Align Inventory Overview and Purchasing LiveViews to consume the new metrics payloads for PO creation.
- Refresh Inventory/Purchasing docs and quick actions to reference the Overview page for production commitments context.

### User Stories

- As a purchasing manager, I review reorder suggestions by supplier and raise a PO in one click.
- As a stock controller, I transfer inventory between locations and consignments with audit history.
- As an owner, I perform rolling stocktakes that feed accuracy metrics without shutting down operations.

### Requirements

**Inventory & Locations**

- [ ] Introduce `Inventory.Location` resource, transfer actions, and consignment tracking.
- [ ] Location revenue/expense reporting aligned with orders.
- [ ] Reorder engine considers lead time, safety stock, and upcoming production.

**UI**

- [ ] Inventory Overview tab: low-stock banner, forecast chart, reorder table grouped by supplier.
- [ ] Purchasing LiveView: PO quick-create from suggestions, status tracker.
- [ ] Stocktake workflow LiveView with guided counts (random/category/age-based selection) and variance report.

**Data & Integrations**

- [ ] Optional barcode import/export hooks for stocktakes (CSV upload now, future scanner integration).
- [ ] Seeds include multi-location scenario (main bakery + farmer's market consignment).

### Acceptance Criteria

- Reorder suggestions compute quantity with formula (forecast demand + safety stock - on hand - on order) and surface supplier.
- Forecast grid refresh stays under 200 ms server-side for 500 materials × 28-day horizon while surfacing risk state, stockout/order-by dates, and suggested PO per plan.
- Stocktake completion generates variance adjustment entries and accuracy metrics.
- Purchasing flow updates inventory upon receiving and closes suggestion.

### Implementation Notes

- Extend `InventoryForecasting` module; add tests covering location splits.
- Use LiveView streams for long reorder lists.
- Document stocktake best practices in guides.

- Catalog sync updates WhatsApp within sync cycle when products change
- Message templates render correctly with order-specific data (items, totals, pickup time)
- Failed messages surface in admin UI with retry options

### Implementation Notes

- Build generic channel adapter pattern that Shopify/Etsy can later implement
- Use pattern matching for message parsing (order intent, product queries, status requests)
- Consider storing conversation context in memory vs. DB (cost/speed tradeoff)
- Manual CSV import remains available as fallback for offline/no-integration scenarios

## Backlog -- E-commerce Channel Sync

**Target:** Post-MVP (after M6 completion)

**Scope:** Shopify, Etsy, Square, Faire integrations for automated order import and inventory sync

**Rationale for deferring:**

- WhatsApp covers direct customer communication (higher priority for bakeries)
- CSV import handles bulk order scenarios
- Channel sync becomes more valuable once costing, forecasting, and insights are proven
- Can validate channel adapter pattern with WhatsApp first

**Future User Stories:**

- As a seller, I sync orders from Shopify/Etsy into OpenSauce and keep inventory levels aligned
- As an operator, I receive marketplace orders alongside WhatsApp/manual orders in unified queue
- As a multi-channel seller, I see inventory automatically reserved across all channels

---

## Tracking & Delivery

- Keep `PLAN.md` milestone checkboxes in sync with progress; update "Last updated" date per change.
- Run `mix ash_postgres.generate_migrations` after domain changes and commit snapshots.
- Tests to add as features land:
  - BOM cost calculator edge cases (`test/opensauce/catalog`).
  - Traceability recall flow (`test/opensauce/traceability`).
  - Reorder suggestion algorithm (`test/opensauce/inventory`).
  - WhatsApp integration adapters (mock API clients).
  - Insights dashboard LiveView tests using fixtures.
- Documentation touchpoints: update README feature matrix + guides after each milestone.
- Competitive watch: review Craftybase roadmap quarterly and fold learnings into this plan.
